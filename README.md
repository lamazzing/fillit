# fillit
Fillit is a variation of the game Tetris. 
The program takes a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos (pieces) and arranges them to create the smallest square possible. The main goal is to find this smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
